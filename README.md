# Prisma Rust Quiz #4

This time we have a simple database project we want to test. Whenever we have
exactly the same datasets, we want to be able to say they are the same set.

The dataset contains `Itemizable` items, implementing the trait and returning
the correct foreign key.

In the example the test to compare two datasets doesn't compile. Investigate
different ways of solving the problem without losing the original functionality.

There can be many different solutions, all discussion is welcome.

## Running the tests

``` sh
cargo test
```
